# cellar.social
A wine-centric NOSTR relay and magic webstore.


A NOSTR relay can be used to create a wine-centric "cellar.social" + merchant. 
The social network allows users to post and share reviews, tasting notes, and other wine-related content. Users can also follow other users, send direct messages, and stay up-to-date on wine trends and recommendations. Several tiers of membership from free to premium access. 
The magic webstore feature allows wine merchants to list their products, accept payments through the Nostr relay using the Bitcoin Lightning network, and arrange shipping directly to customers' addresses. Nostr relays offer advantages such as decentralisation, open source code, and scalability, making them resistant to censorship, transparent, secure, and capable of handling a large number of users and transactions.
